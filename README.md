## üìñ About
- **Problem**: 
    - Learn how to define a prediction task
    - Selecting evaluation metrics and baseline models
    - Perform feature engineering and standarization
    - Training and using predictive models: Univariable and Multivariate Linear Regression, Classification
    - Understand how Gradient Descent works by implementing a Linear Regressor in python

- **Industries**: fintech, banks, insurtech, many others related. 

- **Solution**:
Predict whether a person applying for a home credit will be able to repay their debt or not. Data pre-processing for a large dataset of +350,000 transactions. Trained many supervised models achieving +0.72 ROC AUC. Models used where DecisionTree, XGBoost and LightGBM.

You can see the whole project in the following **notebook**:
 - [Home credit default risk](https://github.com/agusle/nba-players-predictions/blob/main/home-credit-default-risk.ipynb)
